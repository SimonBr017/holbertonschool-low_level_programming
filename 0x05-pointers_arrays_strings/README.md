0-reset_to_98.c :nction that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to 98

1-swap.c: function that swaps the values of two integers.

2-strlen.c: function that returns the length of a string.

3-puts.c:  function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.

    Prototype: void _puts(char *str);

4-print_rev.c:  function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.

5-rev_string.c: function that reverses a string. 

6-puts2.c: function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.

7-puts_half.c: function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.

    Prototype: void puts_half(char *str);
    The function should print the second half of the string
    If the number of characters is odd, the function should print the last n characters of the string, where n = (length_of_the_string - 1) / 2

8-print_array.c: function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.

    Prototype: void print_array(int *a, int n);
    where n is the number of elements of the array to be printed
    Numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space
    The numbers should be displayed in the same order as they are stored in the array
    You are allowed to use printf

9. strcpy: Prototype: char *_strcpy(char *dest, char *src);
